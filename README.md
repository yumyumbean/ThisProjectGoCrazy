2 player hoop game with led and light feedback

Swagsketball is a 1-2 player co-op experience. The game was designed with score tracking in mind, no more cheating!
## GETTING STARTED
You press the white button to view the rules and start the game. The black button can be used to reset the score, either for foul play or just to start a new set. The device comes with a launcher that can be used for extra hard mode, but the main way to play is to bounce the ball off a hard surface first.
## HARD MODE
Hard mode will be activated at 8-9 points with the difficulty ramping up for each score in order. The hard mode will be in the form of 2 fans that can ultimately be set up however the user pleases. The recommended order is for both of the fans to point towards eachother but slightly ahead and behind eachother. 
## SCORING
The score will go up every time the ball passes through the "goal" and breaks the contact of the laser inside the device. the game is won at 10 points, and all external devices will disconnect. The black button should be used at this time to reset the score, and you can start again.
